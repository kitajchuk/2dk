### Getting started

Install the packages for Clutch:

```shell
npm run bootstrap
```

Install the packages for the studio software:

```shell
cd studio && npm i
```

Start the Clutch local development kit:

```shell
npm start
```



### Studio software
The studio software is an Electron application. To run the app:

```shell
npm run studio
```

The repository has a couple of game projects that are being used as proof-of-concept to develop the 2dk player and studio software. When you run the studio you'll find these games loaded and can explore the map builder with the maps I have been working on.

This software is actively being designed and developed. It's a passion project that has no defined roadmap as of yet. That being said, it is a feature-driven and iterative product. As I build features into the player I then build them into the studio software. Right now the studio software is basically like Photoshop for painting 2D tile maps with a collision layer.
