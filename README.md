### Getting started

Install the packages for the project:

```shell
npm run bootstrap
```

Start the Clutch local development kit:

```shell
npm start
```



### Studio software
The studio software is an Electron application. To run the app:

```shell
npm run studio
```

The repository has a couple of game projects that are being used as proof-of-concept to develop the 2dk player and studio software. When you run the studio you'll find these games loaded and can explore the map builder with the maps I have been working on.
